# INTERNAL MEMORANDUM

**TO:** Lead Data Analyst  
**FROM:** Office of the CEO  
**DATE:** July 26, 2025  
**PRIORITY:** URGENT  
**SUBJECT:** **Project Assignment: Deep Dive Analysis into Sales Conversion Rates**

---

### 1. Project Background & Business Problem

As you know, our company's growth is directly tied to our ability to effectively convert sales leads into customers. At present, our overall conversion rate for travel packages is approximately **19%**. While steady, this figure is below our quarterly target and indicates a significant opportunity for improvement. We are investing heavily in lead generation and sales efforts, and it is imperative that we maximize the return on that investment.

To that end, your department has been tasked with conducting a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on our `Travel.csv` dataset.

### 2. Mission Objective

The primary objective of this project is to move beyond high-level metrics and identify specific, data-driven, and actionable insights that will enable us to increase our sales conversion rate.

I am not looking for a simple report on what the data says. I expect a strategic analysis that answers the fundamental business question: **"How do we sell more packages, and to whom?"**

### 3. Key Areas of Investigation

Your analysis should focus on providing clear answers to the following critical questions:

* **Define Our "Golden Customer":** I need a precise profile of the customer who is most likely to buy. You must investigate key demographics, including but not limited to:
    * `MonthlyIncome`
    * `Age`
    * `Designation` and `Occupation`

* **Evaluate Our Sales Strategy:** I need to know which of our sales tactics are effective and which are wasting resources. Please analyze:
    * The performance of our lead sources (`TypeofContact`).
    * The success rate of each `ProductPitched`.

* **Identify Key Qualifying Indicators:** Are there simple factors that signal a high-intent buyer? I want to know if attributes like `Passport` ownership have a significant impact on conversion.

### 4. Expected Deliverable

The final output of this project should be a concise, one-page summary of your findings presented in a formal memo. This report must include your top 3-4 key insights, supported by clear visualizations, and conclude with **three concrete, actionable recommendations** that the sales and marketing teams can implement immediately.

This project is a top priority for this quarter. I look forward to reviewing your findings.

Regards,

**A. CEO** Your Travel Company

    " A set is often preferred over a list when you need to store unique elements and perform efficient membership testing. Unlike lists, sets automatically eliminate duplicates, making them ideal for scenarios where data integrity and uniqueness are important- For example, storing unique user IDs or removing repeated entries from a dataset. \n",

    "In Python, a string is a sequence of characters enclosed in single (') or double (\") quotes. It is used to represent textual data, such as words, sentences, or even numbers written as text. Strings are immutable, which means once they are created, their contents cannot be changed—you cannot modify individual characters directly. \n",

    "\n",
    "While both strings and lists are sequential (ordered) and support indexing and slicing, the key difference lies in mutability and the type of data they hold: strings only hold characters, whereas lists can hold a mix of data types. For example, you can append a number to a list, but you cannot append it to a string without creating a new one. These differences affect how they are used in programs—strings are great for fixed or read-only text, while lists are useful for dynamic collections of items."
